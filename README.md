# die-bibel-scraper-DE

This tool can package all German bibles from bibleserver.com nicely:
1. as MYBIBLE-Files for [MySword Bible](https://www.mysword.info)
2. as SQLITE-File for [OpenLP Presenter Software](https://openlp.org/)

**Please respect the copyright and don't publish bible texts anywhere without consent of the publishers!**

Support for English and Spanish translations is included, but disabled in the released JAR file. If needed, this functionality must be activated in the source code and a new JAR file compiled manually.

## Usage

Start the released JAR using Java 11 or above with an (empty) directory as parameter, e.g.

`java -jar bibleserver-scraper-DE-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar PATH/TO/TARGET/DIRECTORY`

It will show you on the standard output what it does. If all goes well, it will create 3 German bible modules
(BB, LU84, NGUE [unvollst√§ndig]) for MySword (.mybible) and OpenLP (.sqlite).

## MySword Bible modules

You have to copy the resulting files to your device, either by mailing them to yourself or via Android Debug Bridge:

`adb push *.mybible /storage/emulated/0/mysword/bibles`

## OpenLP Bible modules

In order to use exported bibles in OpenLP you have to copy SQLITE-Files to your OpenLP-Data-Folder.

On Windows-System this folder can be found at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\openlp\data\bibles`

On Linux-Systems it is `/home/<user>/.config/OpenLP/`
